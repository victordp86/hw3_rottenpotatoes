Feature: display list of movies filtered by MPAA rating

  As a concerned parent
  So that I can quickly browse movies appropriate for my family
  I want to see movies matching only certain MPAA ratings

Background: movies have been added to database

  Given the following movies exist:

  | The Terminator          | R      | 26-Oct-1984  |
  | When Harry Met Sally    | R      | 21-Jul-1989  |
  | The Help                | PG-13  | 10-Aug-2011  |
  | Chocolat                | PG-13  | 5-Jan-2001   |
  | Amelie                  | R      | 25-Apr-2001  |
